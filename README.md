## Making CommitNotify Globally Accessible <a name="making-commitnotify-globally-accessible"></a>
To make CommitNotify globally accessible and at your fingertips, follow these steps:

1. **Unix-like Operating Systems (Linux, macOS)**:
   - Make the `commitnotify.py` script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x commitnotify.py
   ```
   - Copy the script into a directory within your system PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`, and give it a memorable name (e.g., `commitnotify`):
   ```
   sudo cp commitnotify.py /usr/local/bin/commitnotify
   ```

2. **Windows**:
   - Copy the `commitnotify.py` file to a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\scripts`).
   - Rename it for easy recall (e.g., `commitnotify`).
   - Press the Windows key, search for "Environment Variables," and select "Edit the system environment variables."
   - In the System Properties window, navigate to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables."
   - Under "System variables," locate the `Path` variable, select it, and click "Edit."
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New," then "Browse." Navigate to the directory where you copied `commitnotify.py` (e.g., `C:\scripts`), select it, and click "OK."
   - Click "OK" to close all open windows.

Now, you can effortlessly run CommitNotify from anywhere using the `commitnotify` command on Unix-like systems or `commitnotify.py` on Windows. Experience the convenience! ðŸš€
